				<h1>About me</h1>
				<hr>

				<p>
					Hey, I'm Tim, a partially self-taught developer from Germany. I got into
					programming at around 2011 out of curiosity and it stuck with me since.
				</p><br>

				<p>
					Video games have been a huge part of my life - not just playing them, but
					also modifying and experimenting with them. Whether it was tweaking game files,
					building small prototypes, or just finding out how it all works behind the
					scenes, I've always enjoyed the creative and technical aspects of game development.
				</p><br>

				<p>
					If I had to trace it all back to the beginning, it would probably be those
					nights as a kid, hiding under my blanket with my Nintendo DS, pretending to be
					asleep whenever my mom checked in.
				</p><br><br>
