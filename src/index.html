				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<hr>

				<p>
					Hey, I'm Tim, a partially self-taught developer, born in 1996 in Germany. I got into
					programming at around 2011 out of curiosity and it stuck with me since.
				</p><br>

				<p>
					My hobbies aren't anything special. I like playing games and tinkering with them, as well
					as creating prototypes. Photography used to be a hobby, but I'm lacking inspiration for it
					at the moment. Other than that, I enjoy occasionally talking with friends or watching movies.
				</p><br>

				<h1>What I'm Like as a Developer</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
					I like to think of myself as more of a creative coder than anything else. My ideas come in
					bursts, and turning the fun ones into code is what I enjoy most. I'm not a visual artist by
					any stretch, as I'm much more suited for building systems, mechanics or prototypes.
				</p><br>

				<p>
					The part I enjoy most is seeing stuff come to life. Spending days (or even weeks) coding and
					finally seeing it work is something special. An example for that would be my shader project,
					which is fun because I'm seeing results immediately, but it's also a reality check. Turns out
					I don't know as much math as I thought I did.
				</p><br>

				<h1>Shader Development</h1>
				<hr>

				<p>
					As of April 2025, I'm experimenting with GLSL - specifically WebGL.
					While there are websites to create and share your own shaders, I still
					wanted a way of having more control and really know what goes into
					making a shader, rather than being spoon-fed everything - even if
					that means having a sub-optimal solution for the beginning.
				</p><br>

				<p>
					And yes, I know that using WebGL is technically not as bare bones as
					I could get (and also not as performant as I could get), but it's just
					a way to get started. I don't feel like over engineering everything.
				</p><br>

				<p>
					I will be hosting all shaders I'm creating <a href="./shaders" target="_blank">here on my website</a>.
